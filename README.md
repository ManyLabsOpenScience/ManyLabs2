## Lookup tables used to generate datasets and analyses

* [**masterKey**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fqK3WHwFPMIjNVVvmxpMEjzUETftq_DmP5LzEhXxUHA/edit?usp=sharing) - Contains the **R** code for all analyses
* [**sourceInfo**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qn_kVkVGwffBAmhAbpgrTjdxKLP1bb2chHjBMVyGl1s/edit?usp=sharing) - Contains information about all particpating labs (sources)
* [**Codebook for primary analyses**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DK2YrekUsfCFcgxyUnIy4-5oyunne8lk7i8CcsWWw9w/edit?usp=sharing)
* [**Filename Filters**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OLKcyyoYfPds5s4wRpqzXU3lACFr94Ve-cR2l_zodtU/edit?usp=sharing) - Some filenames and sourcenames had to be adjusted, this table records those adjustments.
* [**Zhong Text**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J9I1JVTQqCrC7x5gz3TzA7sUCvjKJGfz0nh8EgfVAVs/edit?usp=sharing) - The different translations of the text used in the Zhong et al. study, including character count , participants had to copy more than half of the text to be included in analyses.
* [**Zavani Unique Values**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aJJcCk8UvefbSAIePhmh6kEolOc5RwwB3cC_hBtrH5c/edit?usp=sharing) - Contains the unique responses given in the Zavani et al. study for all languages, including a categorisation of whether the response was correct or not.
